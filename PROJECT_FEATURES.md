## Registrations: Implement User Registrations Page
This page is designed for users (e.g., law enforcement officers, security personnel) to register their accounts and gain access to the criminal face detection system. The registration process ensures that only authorized personnel can use the system to view criminal face detection alerts, profiles, and investigation data.
